happiNES-dev
============

An attempt at bolting on some NES development tools to the Arduino PDE (much like Arduino built on top of Processing).

Getting Started
---------------
Download the correct package for your platform.  Unzip and fire it up.  Starting with the examples under the File->Examples menu is probably the best way to start.

Dependencies
-----------
* python - Needed to run the assembler Ophis.


Notes
-----
* Not truly cross-platform at the moment.  I am only building and testing on windows, but it is possible to get going on other platforms with a little work.
* The assembler is Ophis which uses the p65 spec.  Copyright © 2006-7 Michael Martin
* The emulator is vNES.  Copyright © 2006-2010 Jamie Sanders
